To install Ariadne, you will need the following packages:
  GNU Multiple Precision Library (v>=4.1.2) http://www.swox.com/gmp/
  MPFR Library (v>=2.0.1)                   http://www.mpfr.org/
  Boost C++ Libraries (v1.33.1)             http://www.boost.org/
  Parma Polyhedra Library (v0.8)            http://www.cs.unipr.it/ppl/

To compile the library, you will need a C++ compiler.
  GCC/G++ (v>=4.0.2)                        http://gcc.gnu.org/

For the Python interface, you will also need
  Python (v2.4)                             http://www.python.org/

To generate the documentation, you will need
  Doxygen (v>=1.4.4)                      http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/

Since the current version is a beta version, we have only tested against the 
libraries stated above. Any other versions (including newer versions) may not 
work.

To compile Ariadne, including the Python interface, change to directory trunk/ 
in the source tree, and type
> make install
The shared object files in $(PREFIX)/lib/ , and the Python interface in 
$(PREFIX)/python/ . To change these settings, edit the file config.mk .

To compile without Python, type
> make lib
and install the resulting library libariadne.so manually.

To make the documentation, type
> make doc
or 
> doxygen
The main page of the html documentation will appear in html/index.html .
