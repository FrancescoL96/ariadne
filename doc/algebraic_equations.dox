\page algebraic_equations_page Algebraic Equations

Consider the system of nonlinear algebraic equations
\f[ f(x) = 0; \quad x\in D \f]
where \f$f:\R^n\rightarrow \R^n\f$ and \f$D\f$ is a compact box in \f$\R^n\f$.


\section interval_newton The Interval Newton Method

The interval Newton method is a direct intervalisation of the standard Newton method. Suppose \f$[x]\f$ is a box and \f$x\in[x]\f$.
Suppose further that there is a zero of \f$f\f$ at \f$x^*\in[x]\f$. Then by Taylor's theorem we have
\f[ 0 = f_i(x^*) = f_i(x) + Df_i(\xi_i) (x^*-x)  \f]
for some \f$\xi\in[x]\f$. Denoting the matrix formed by the gradients of \f$Df_i(\xi_i)\f$ by \f$Df(\xi)\f$ (note that this is \emph{not} \f$Df\f$ evaluated at a single point \f$\xi\f$, we obtain
\f[ 0 = f(x^*) = f(x) + Df(\xi) (x^*-x)  \f]
and by rearranging,
\f[ x^* = x - Df(\xi)^{-1} f(x) . \f]
The interval Newton method is given by the contraction algorithm
\f[ \framebox{$ [x_{n+1}] = [x_n] \cap \bigl( x_n - Df[x_n]^{-1} f(x_n) \bigr) $} \f]
where \f$x_n\in[x_n]\f$ and \f$Df[x]\f$ is the interval matrix of all partial derivatives \f$ \partial f_i/\partial x_j[x]\f$.

\section krawczyk The Krawczyk  method

The main disadvantage of the interval Newton method is the need to invert the interval matrix \f$Df[x]\f$ which can be very wide.
The Krawczyk method is a modification of the interval Newton method which avoids this difficulty.

Let \f$x\in[x]\f$ and \f$J\f$ be any matrix. Then from the equation,
\f[ 0 = f(x) + Df(\xi) (x^*-x)  \f]
we multiply through by \f$ -J \f$ to obtain
\f[ 0 = -Jf(x) - JDf(\xi)(x^*-x)  \f]
Now add \f$(x^*-x)\f$ to both sides to obtain
\f[ x^*-x = -Jf(x) + (I - JDf(\xi)) (x^*-x)  \f]
and rearrange to obtain
\f[ x^* = x -Jf(x) + (I - JDf(\xi)) (x^*-x) . \f]
The Krawczyk method is given by the contraction algorithm
\f[ \framebox{$ [x_{n+1}] = [x_n] \cap \bigl( x_n -J_nf(x_n) + (I - J_nDf[x_n]) ([x_n]-x]) \bigr) $} \f]
Typically, we take either
\f[ \framebox{$ J = \mathrm{mid}(Df[x]) \text{ or } J=Df(x) $} \f]

\section modified_krawczyk The Modified Krawczyk  Method

The main disadvantage of the Krawczyk method is the need to compute the matrix \f$I-JDf[x_n]\f$ explicitly, since otherwise the interval errors are too large. This is especially undesirable if \f$Df\f$ is sparse, since then typically \f$J\f$ will not be sparse, and while \f$JDf[x_n]\f$ will typically be close to \f$I\f$, the off-diagonal elements are significant. However, we can avoid losing the structure of \f$Df\f$ by the following modification.

Let \f$K\f$ be any matrix. Then from the equation
\f[ 0 = f(x) + Df(\xi) (x^*-x)  \f]
we negate the left-hand side and add \f$K(x^*-x)\f$ to both sides to obtain
\f[ K(x^*-x) = -f(x) + (K-Df(\xi)) (x^*-x)  \f]
Hence
\f[ x^* = x - K^{-1} \bigl( f(x) + (Df(\xi)-K) (x^*-x) \bigr) \f]
This gives a modified contraction algorithm
\f[ [x_{n+1}] = x_n - [K_n^{-1}] \bigl( f(x_n) + (Df[x_n]-K_n) ([x_n]-x_n) \bigr) \f]
Typically, we take \f$K=\mid(Df[x])\f$ so that \f$Df[x_n]-K_n\f$ is the matrix \f$\mathrm{rad}(Df[x_n])\f$.
Note that we need to take an interval solver for finding \f$K^{-1}\f$, since the method is only valid if \f$[K^{-1}]\f$ contains the exact inverse of \f$K\f$.

In many cases, we have a factorisation \f$K=PQR\f$ where \f$P^{-1}\f$ and \f$R^{-1}\f$ are sparse matrices which can be easily and exactly computed, and \f$Q\f$ is block-diagonal. We can then write \f$[Q]=[P^{-1}KR^{-1}]\f$ where the inverses are exact and the product is computed with interval arithmetic. Then \f$K^{-1} \in R^{-1} [Q]^{-1} P^{-1} = [K^{-1}]\f$, so the equation \f$K[x]=[r]\f$ can be solved easily.

As an example, in using the modified Krawczyk method to solve the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions for nonlinear optimisation, we have to invert the matrix
\f[ \left(\begin{matrix} Z&0&X\\-A&H&0\\0&A^T&I\\ \end{matrix}\right) \f]
which factorises
\f[
    \left(\begin{matrix} Z&0&X\\-A&H&0\\0&A^T&I\\ \end{matrix}\right)
        =
    \left(\begin{matrix} Z&0&0 \\ 0&I&0 \\ 0&0&I \end{matrix}\right)
    \left(\begin{matrix} I&0&0 \\ -A&I&AZ^{-1}X \\ 0&0&I \end{matrix}\right)
    \left(\begin{matrix} I&0&0 \\ 0&H-AZ^{-1}XA^T&0 \\ 0&0&I \end{matrix}\right)
    \left(\begin{matrix} I&0&0 \\ 0&I&0 \\ 0&A^T&I \end{matrix}\right)
    \left(\begin{matrix} I&0&Z^{-1}X \\ 0&I&0 \\ 0&0&I \end{matrix}\right)
\f]
To compute the full interval inverse, we only need to invert the matrix \f$[H-AZ^{-1}XA^T]\f$, which is small and dense.
