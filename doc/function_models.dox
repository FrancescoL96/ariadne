\page function_models_page Function Models

A \em model for a function \f$f:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m\f$ is an approximation of \f$f\f$ on some domain \f$D\f$.
A \em validated model describes a set of possibilities for \f$f\f$, such as a ball around some fixed approximation in a function norm, whereas an \em approximate model merely gives an approxmation, with no guarantees on the true value.

A particularly useful approach is to first \em scale or otherwise perform a mapping of \f$D\f$ to a canonical domain, typically \f$[-1\!:\!+1]^n\f$, though for Fourier approximations we may prefer variables in \f$[-\pi\!:\!+\pi]\f$.
We shall henceforth assume that our function models are defined on a rescaled domain.


\section polynomial_models Polynomial Models

A polynomial model represent represents a function \f$f\f$ on \f$X\f$ by in terms of a polynomial over \f$D\f$.

We recall that a polynomial \f$p\f$ in \f$n\f$ variables \f$(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\f$ can be written as
\f[ p(x) = \sum_{\alpha\in \aleph} c_{\alpha}\,x^{\alpha} . \f]
Here, \f$\alpha\f$ is a multi-index \f$(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_m)\f$ with degree \f$|\alpha|=\alpha_1+\cdots+\alpha_m\f$, and \f$x^\alpha := x_1^{\alpha_1}\,x_2^{\alpha_2}\,\cdots\,x_m^{\alpha_m}\f$, and \f$\aleph\f$ is a finite set of multi-indices.
We will write \f$\alpha_i\f$ for the multi-index \f$(\alpha_i)_i=1\f$, \f$(\alpha_i)_j=0,\;i\neq j\f$.
The coefficients \f$c_\alpha\f$ are constants of a real-number type depending on the representation of the model.

In an \em approximate model, the coefficients are approximate values \f$\tilde{c}_\alpha\f$, typically of some \ref Approximation "Approximation<FLT> class.
The model is then an approximate polynomial \f[ \textstyle \tilde{p}(x) = \sum_{\alpha\in\aleph} \tilde{c}_\alpha x^\alpha \f] such that \f$\tilde{p} \approx f\f$ over \f$D\f$.

There are many kinds of \em validated model.

A simple class of validated models can be described
\f[ \hat{p}(z) = \sum_\alpha c_\alpha z^\alpha \pm e = p(z)\pm \varepsilon \f]
which describes a continuous function in the set
\f[ \textstyle \langle p \pm \varepsilon\rangle = \{ f : D\to\R \mid \forall _{z\in D} | f(z) - p(z) | \leq \varepsilon \} . \f]
In other words, \f$\hat{p}\f$ is the ball of radius \f$e\f$ around \f$p(z)=\sum_\alpha c_\alpha z^\alpha\f$ in the uniform (\f$L^\infty\f$) norm.
Note that this model class does not support differentiation, since (here, restricting to one dimension) for any differentiable function \f$e\f$ with \f$\|e\|_\infty\leq \varepsilon\f$, we could have \f$f'(z) = \sum_{\alpha} \alpha c_\alpha z^{\alpha-1} + e'(z)\f$, so the derivative at any point can be made to take an arbitrary value.

\subsection higher_order_function_models Higher Order Function Models

We can also consider models in higher differentiability classes by keeping track of higher-order norms.
For example, we can keep track of error bounds \f$\varepsilon_\alpha\f$ on \f$\partial^\alpha f/\partial z^\alpha\f$ for \f$|\alpha|=1\f$ to obtain a <em>\f$C^1\f$ function model</em>.
Here, it is also useful to keep track of the error \f$\delta_0\f$ at \f$z=0\f$, since then we have the following bound on the uniform error:
\f[ \textstyle \sup_{z\in D}|f(z)-p(z)| \leq \delta_0 + \sum_i \epsilon_{\alpha_i} z_i , \f]

\subsection interval_taylor_models Interval Taylor Models

We can construct polynomial models using coefficients which are themselves non-exact:
\f[ \textstyle \hat{p}(z) = \sum_\alpha \hat{c}_\alpha z^\alpha \f]

\subsubsection interval_taylor_model_semantics Semantics

Here there are two distinct interpretations:
 - (i) We can assume that the \f$\hat{c}_\alpha\f$ are bounds for some fixed, but unknown value.
In this case, \f$\langle \hat{p} \rangle\f$ is a set of \em polynomials:
\f[ \textstyle \langle \hat{p} \rangle = \{ f : D\to\R \mid \forall \alpha\in\aleph,\ \exists c_\alpha \in \hat{c}_\alpha,\ \forall z\in D,\ f(z) = \sum_\alpha c_\alpha z^\alpha \} , \f]
 - (ii) We can assume that the \f$\widehat{c}_\alpha\f$ are bounds on the range of a function which may itself depend on \f$z\f$.
In this case, we give the semantics:
\f[ \textstyle \langle \hat{p} \rangle = \{ f : D\to\R \mid \forall z\in D,\ \forall \alpha\in\aleph,\ \exists c_\alpha\in\widehat{c}_\alpha,\ f(z) = \sum_\alpha c_\alpha z^\alpha \} , \f]
or equivalently,
\f[ \textstyle \langle \hat{p} \rangle = \{ f : D\to\R \mid \forall \alpha\in\aleph,\ \exists \gamma_\alpha:D\to\widehat{c}_\alpha,\ f(z) = \sum_\alpha \gamma_\alpha(z) z^\alpha \} . \f]
Note that the interpretation (ii) gives more possible choices of \f$f\f$.

Interpretation (i) only allows representation of polynomial functions.
For this reason, one would typically introduce an additional uniform remainder term:
\f[ \textstyle \hat{p}(z) = \sum_\alpha \hat{c}_\alpha z^\alpha \pm e \f]
to allow representation of arbitrary continuous functions
\f[ \textstyle \langle \hat{p}\pm e \rangle = \{ f : D\to\R \mid \forall \alpha\in\aleph,\ \exists c_\alpha \in \hat{c}_\alpha,\ \forall z\in D, \ \exists \epsilon\in e,\ f(z) = \sum_\alpha c_\alpha z^\alpha + \epsilon \} , \f]
Interpretation (ii) allows for the interpretation of analytic functions e.g.
\f[ \exp(z) \in 1+z+\cdots + \frac{1}{(n-1)!}z^{n-1} + \frac{[0.25\!:\!2.75]}{n!} z^{n} \subset \Bigl(1+\frac{[-2.75\!:\!2.75]}{n!}\Bigr) + z + \cdots + \frac{1}{(n-1)!} z^{n-1} . \f]

\subsubsection interval_taylor_model_arithmetic Arithmetic

In both cases, arithmetic can be performed by using interval arithmetic on the coefficients:
\f[ \begin{aligned} \textstyle (\sum_\alpha \hat{a}_\alpha z^\alpha) + (\sum_\beta \hat{b}_\beta z^\beta) &= \textstyle \sum_{\gamma} \bigl( \hat{a}_\gamma + \hat{b}_\gamma \bigr) z^\gamma \\
\textstyle (\sum_\alpha \hat{a}_\alpha z^\alpha) \times (\sum_\beta \hat{b}_\beta z^\beta) &= \textstyle \sum_{\gamma} \bigl( \sum_{\alpha+\beta=\gamma} \hat{a}_\alpha \times \hat{b}_\beta \bigr) z^\gamma . \end{aligned} \f]
and composition by using the addition and multiplication operations so defined.

\subsubsection interval_taylor_model_differentiation Differentiation

Howerver, interpretation (ii) does not support differentiation, since
\f[ \frac{d}{dz} \sum_k \gamma_k(z) z^k = \sum_k \bigl( \gamma_k'(z) + (k+1) \gamma_{k+1}(z) \bigr) z^k , \f]
and \f$\gamma_k'(z)\f$ cannot be bounded, while In the first interpretation, differentiation can be performed elementwise:
\f[ \frac{d}{dz} \sum_k \hat{c}_k z^k = \sum_k (k+1) \hat{c}_{k+1} z^k , \f]

\subsubsection interval_taylor_model_integration Integration

Integration also differs between the two interpretations. In interpretation (i),
\f[ \int_a^b \sum_k \hat{c}_k z^k ,dz = \sum_k \tfrac{1}{k+1}\hat{c}_k \bigl[ z^{k+1}\bigr]_a^b = \sum_{k} \tfrac{1}{k+1}\hat{c}_k (b^{k+1}-a^{k+1}) , \f]
whereas in the second interpretation (ii),
\f[ \int_a^b \sum_k \hat{c}_k z^k \,dz = \Bigl[{{\sum}_k \tfrac{1}{k+1}\hat{c}_k z^{k+1}}\Bigr]_a^b = \sum_{k} \tfrac{1}{k+1} \bigl(\hat{c}_k b^{k+1}-\hat{c}_k a^{k+1}\bigr) . \f]
These are different, since the distributive law does not hold for interval arithmetic: in general, \f$(b-a)\hat{c} \subsetneq b\hat{c}-a\hat{c}\f$.
However, for interpretation (ii) we can still use
\f[ \int_0^z \sum_k \hat{c}_k \zeta^k \,d\zeta = \Bigl[{{\sum}_k \tfrac{1}{k+1}\hat{c}_k \zeta^{k+1}}\Bigr]_0^z = \sum_{k} \tfrac{1}{k+1} \hat{c}_k z^{k+1} . \f]

\subsubsection interval_taylor_model_multivalued Sets of functions

In many cases, we use interval coefficients when we wish to denote an over-approximation to a \em set of functions, or to a \em multivalued function, rather than a range of possibilities for a \em single function point-valued function.
We henceforth write \f$\widehat{C}_\alpha\f$ where  distinguish use \ref UpperInterval "UpperInterval<FLT>" as the type of coefficient.

- (iii) The interpretation as a set of functions is equivalent to (ii)
\f[ \textstyle \langle \widehat{P} \rangle = \{ f : D\to\R \mid \forall z\in D,\ \forall \alpha\in\aleph,\ \exists c_\alpha\in\widehat{C}_\alpha,\ f(z) = \sum_\alpha c_\alpha z^\alpha \} , \f]

- (iv) The interpretation as a \em multivalued function is
\f[ \textstyle \langle \widehat{P} \rangle = \{ F:D\rightrightarrows\mathbb{R} \mid \forall z, F(z) = \{ w \mid \forall \alpha\in\aleph,\ \exists c_\alpha \in \widehat{C}_\alpha, w=\sum_\alpha c_\alpha z^\alpha\} \} \f]

In both cases, arithmetic is performed as for (i) and (ii), and for case (iii), differentiation is not supported, and integration follows case (ii).


\b Example

Consider the polynomial model \f$\hat{p}(z) = [0:1]+[2:4]z\f$.

In interpretation (i), \f$\langle \hat{p} \rangle\f$ is the set of affine functions \f$ f(z) = c_0 + c_1 z\f$ where \f$c_0\in[0:1]\f$ and \f$c_1\in[2:4]\f$. In this case, the possible values of \f$\int_{-1}^{+1} f(z) dz\f$ are \f$[0:2]\f$, since
\f[ \begin{aligned} \textstyle \int_{-1}^{+1} f(z)dz & = \textstyle \int_{-1}^{+1} c_0 + c_1 z dz=[c_0z+c_1\tfrac{1}{2}z^2]_{-1}^{+1}=c_0[z]_{-1}^{+1}+c_1[\tfrac{1}{2}z^2]_{-1}^{+1} \\ &\textstyle =c_0(1-(-1))+c_1(\tfrac{1}{2}-\tfrac{1}{2})=2c_0 \in [0:2] . \end{aligned} \f]

In interpretation (ii), \f$\langle \hat{p} \rangle\f$ is the set all functions of the form \f$ f(z) = c_0(z) + c_1(z) z\f$ where for all \f$z\f$, \f$c_0(z)\in[0:1]\f$ and \f$c_1(z)\in[2:4]\f$.
In this case, \f$\int_{-1}^{+1} f(z) dz\f$ are \f$[-1:+3]\f$.
The maximum value the integral can take is for \f$f(z)=1+2z\f$ for \f$z\in[-1:0]\f$ and \f$1+4z\f$ for \f$z\in[0:+1]\f$, so
\f[ \textstyle \int_{-1}^{+1} f(z) dz \leq \int_{-1}^{0} 1+2z\,dz + \int_{0}^{+1} 1+4z\,dz = [z+z^2]_{-1}^{0} + [z+2z^2]_{0}^{+1} = (0-0) + (3-0) = 3 . \f]

\b Notation

We henceforth describe a function \f$\hat{p}(z)=\sum_{\alpha} \hat{c}_\alpha z^\alpha\f$ using interpretation (i) as a <em>validated polynomial</em>.
When using the interpretations (ii), we use the terminology <em>varying-coefficient Taylor model</em>, and for (iii), we say <em>interval Taylor model</em>.

See \ref interval_taylor_model_differential_inclusions "Solution (of differential inclusions) using interval Taylor models" for information on using interval Taylor models to solve differential inclusions.

\subsection sweeping Simplification by sweeping

One of the key operations on function models is simplification by \em sweeping, in which small (or high-order) terms are removed by either combining with other terms, or putting into a \em remainder term, such as the error bound.

For a \f$C^0\f$ model \f$p(z)\pm\varepsilon\f$, sweeping yields
\f[ \textstyle \sum_{\alpha\in\alpha_1} c_\alpha z^\alpha + \sum_{\alpha\in\alpha_2} c_\alpha z^\alpha  \pm \varepsilon \preceq
     \sum_{\alpha\in\alpha_1} c_\alpha z^\alpha  \pm \bigl( \varepsilon + \sum_{\alpha\in\alpha_2} |c_\alpha| \|z^\alpha\| \bigr) . \f]
When working on the unit domain, \f$\|z^\alpha\|=1\f$ for all \f$\alpha\f$, so we can take error \f$\varepsilon + \sum_{\alpha\in\alpha_2} |c_\alpha|\f$.

Other model classes can be constructed from these basic building blocks.
For example, we could consider models which are explicitly represented as a composition, or as a sum of other model classes.

\section affine_models Affine Models

An affine model represents a function \f$f\f$ on \f$X\f$ by \f$f(x) = b + A (x-c)\f$.
Given \f$f\f$, an \f$C^1\f$ model can be computed by taking
\f[ [b] \ni f(c); \quad [A] \ni Df(X) \f]




\section function_operation Function Operations

We say a \f$(d,s)\f$-model is a polynomial of maximum degree \f$d\f$, and differentiability class \f$s\f$.

The following operations on functions are supported:
 - Evaluation: If \f$p\f$ is a \f$(d,s)\f$-model \f$\mathbb{R}^m\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n\f$, then \f$p(c_1,\ldots,c_m)\f$ is an interval.
 - Partial evaluation: If \f$p\f$ is a \f$(d,s)\f$-model \f$\mathbb{R}^m\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n\f$, then \f$p(\cdot,\ldots,c_j,\ldots,\cdot)\f$ is a \f$(d,s)\f$-model \f$\mathbb{R}^{m-1}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n\f$.
 - Variable substitution: If \f$p\f$ is a \f$(d,s)\f$-model \f$\mathbb{R}^m\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n\f$,  and \f$q\f$ is a \f$(d,s)\f$-model \f$\mathbb{R}^{m-1}\rightarrow \R\f$, then \f$p(\cdot,\ldots,q(\cdot),\ldots,\cdot)\f$ is a \f$(d,s)\f$-model \f$\mathbb{R}^{m-1}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n\f$.

 - Addition/Subtraction: If \f$p\f$ and \f$q\f$ are \f$(d,s)\f$-models \f$\mathbb{R}^m\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n\f$, then so are \f$p+q\f$ and \f$p-q\f$.
 - Multiplication: If \f$s\f$ is a scalar model \f$(d,s)\f$-model and \f$p\f$ is a \f$(d,s)\f$-model, then \f$s\times p\f$ is a \f$(d,s)\f$-model.
 - Division: If \f$s\f$ is a scalar model and \f$s(x)\neq0\f$, then \f$1/s\f$ is a \f$(d,s)\f$-model.

 - Differentiation: If \f$p\f$ is an \f$(d,s)\f$-model, then the single-variable derivative \f$\frac{\partial p}{\partial x_i}\f$ is a \f$(d-1,s-1)\f$-model.
 - Differentiation: If \f$p\f$ is an \f$(d,s)\f$-model, then the single-variable integral \f$\int^{x_j} p(x_1,\ldots,\xi_j,\ldots,x_m)\,d\xi_j\f$ is a \f$(d,s)\f$-model.

 - Direct sum (combine): If \f$p_1:\mathbb{R}^{m_1}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n_1}\f$ and \f$p_2:\mathbb{R}^{m_2}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n_2}\f$ are \f$(d,s)\f$ models, then so is \f$p_1\oplus p_2 : \mathbb{R}^{m_1+m_2}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n_1+n_2}\f$ given by \f$(p_1\oplus p_2)(x_1,x_2):=(p_1(x_1),p_2(x_2))\f$.
 - Cartesian product (join): If \f$p_1:\mathbb{R}^{m}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n_1}\f$ and \f$p_2:\mathbb{R}^{m}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n_2}\f$ are \f$(d,s)\f$ models, then so is \f$p_1 \times p_2 : \mathbb{R}^{m}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n_1+n_2}\f$ given by \f$(p_1\times p_2)(x):= (p_1(x),p_2(x))\f$.

 - Composition: If \f$p_1:\mathbb{R}^{m}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{l}\f$ and \f$p_2:\mathbb{R}^{l}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}\f$ are \f$(d,s)\f$-models, then \f$p_2\circ p_1\f$ is a \f$(d,s)\f$-model \f$\mathbb{R}^{m}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}\f$.
 - Inverse: If \f$p:\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}\f$ is a \f$(d,s)\f$-model with \f$s\geq1\f$, and if \f$Dp\f$ is nonsingular, then \f$p^{-1}\f$ is a \f$(d,s)\f$ model. The inverse should be centred around \f$y=p(x)\f$, where \f$x\f$ is given, since locally \f$p^{-1}(y)\f$ may have several branches.
 - Implicit: If \f$p:\mathbb{R}^{m}\times\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}\f$ is a \f$(d,s)\f$-model with \f$s\geq1\f$, and if \f$D_2p\f$ is nonsingular near \f$(x,y)\f$, then there is a \f$(d,s)\f$-model \f$q\f$ such that \f$y\in q(x)\f$ and \f$p(x,q(x))=z\f$.

 - Reduce: If \f$p:\mathbb{R}^{m}\times\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}\f$ is a \f$(d_1,s_1)\f$-model, \f$d_2\leq d_1\f$ and \f$s_2\leq\min\{d_2,s_1\}\f$, then \f$p\f$ can be reduced to a \f$(d_2,s_2)\f$-model.




\section function_model_contractors Theory of Contractors

Consider the equation \f$f_i(x_1,\ldots,x_k)=x_i\f$ for \f$i=1,\ldots,k\f$. A \e contractor is a set-based over-approximation to the \f$f_i\f$ working on a class of set with an \e intersection operation. (Actually, all we require of the intersection operation is that it is an over-approximation to the set-theoretic intersection, and that the intersection of \a X and \a Y is a subset of both \a X and \a Y.)

A contractor is \e monotone if \f$f_i(X_1,\ldots,X_k)\subset f_i(Y_1,\ldots,Y_k)\f$ if \f$X_i \subset Y_i\f$ for all \f$i\f$.
Suppose \f$f_i(X_1,\ldots,X_k)=Y_i\subset X_i\f$, and \f$Y_j\subset X_j\f$ for \f$j\neq i\f$. Then \f$f_i(Y_1,\ldots,Y_k)\subset f_i(X_1,\ldots,X_k)\subset Y_i\f$.


A system of contractors applies updates \f$X_i'=f_i(X_1,\ldots,X_k)\cap X_i\f$, possibly performing multiple updates simultaneously.
If \f$f_i\f$ is monotone and \f$f_i(X_1,\ldots,X_k)\subset X_i\f$ at one stage, then inclusion holds at all stages.
We can therefore apply contractors \f$f_i\f$ sequentially or in parallel. If for any \f$i\f$, \f$f_i(X_1,\ldots,X_k)\cap X_i = \emptyset\f$, then there is no fixed-point. If for all \f$i\f$, \f$f_i(X_1,\ldots,X_k)\subset X_i\f$, then there is at least one solution in \f$X_1\times\cdots\times X_k\f$.

The Taylor calculus operations are not monotone, since refining an argument may cause terms to be swept into the error. Further, the intersection of two Taylor expressions need not be a subset of either argument due to round-off error.
However, both operations are over-approximations of the exact operations, and this allows us to prove the existence of solutions.

Suppose \f$f_i\f$ are monotone contractors, \f$\hat{f}_i\f$ are non-monotone numerical over-approximations to the \f$f_i\f$, and \f$\sqcap\f$ is an over-approximation to the intersection operator.
Consider a system of contractors, \f$X_i'=\hat{f}_i(X_1,\ldots,X_k) \sqcap X_i\f$.
Suppose that for all \f$i\f$ at some stage of the operation, \f$\hat{f}_i(X_1,\ldots,X_k) \subset X_i\f$. Then the final result contains a solution of \f$f_i(x_1,\ldots,x_k)=x_i;\ i=1,\ldots,k\f$.

Consider the two-variable case. Suppose \f$\hat{f}_1(X_1,X_2)\subset X_1\f$, and that after applying some numerical contractors to obtain \f$(Y_1,Y_2)\f$ we have \f$\hat{f}_2(Y_1,Y_2)\subset Y_2\f$. Let \f$\tilde{Y}_1\f$ be the set obtained by applying the monotone contractors. Then \f$f_2(\tilde{Y}_1,Y_2)\subset f_2(Y_1,Y_2) \subset \hat{f}_2(Y_1,Y_2) \subset Y_2\f$, and \f$f_1(\tilde{Y}_1,Y_2)\subset \tilde{Y}_1\f$. Hence \f$(\tilde{Y}_1,Y_2)\f$ contains a solution, and therefore so does \f$(Y_1,Y_2)\f$.
