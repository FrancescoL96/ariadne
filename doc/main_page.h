\section mainpage_introduction Introduction

%Ariadne is a C++ package for set-based analysis of dynamical and control systems, including reachability analysis, robust simulation and safety verification. The package can handle systems with reset, flow and guard predicates given by nonlinear functions, making it one of the most general-purpose reachability tools available. 

The homepage of %Ariadne is <a href="http://ariadne.parades.rm.cnr.it/">http://ariadne.parades.rm.cnr.it/</a>.

\section mainpage_installation Installation

Full instructions on downloading and installing %Ariadne can be found on the <a href="installation.html">%Installation</a> page.


\section mainpage_getting_started Getting Started

An overview of %Ariadne's capabilities is given on the <a href="overview.html">Overview</a> documentation page.

An example of the use of %Ariadne for reachability analysis of a simple hybrid system is given in the <a href="../examples/tutorial.cc">tutorial.cc</a> file. The same example using the python interface is given in <a href="../examples/tutorial.py">tutorial.py</a>  (forthcoming).

\section mainpage_documentation Further Documentation

A more detailed description of %Ariadne's capabilities can be found in the documentation for the individual <a href="modules.html">Modules</a>.
Some more information on the mathematical foundations of %Ariadne can be found in the <a href="pages.html">Related Pages</a>.
